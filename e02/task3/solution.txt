/bin/true is a command that returns 0 (a truth value in the shell).

Its purpose is to use in places in a shell script where you would normally use a literal such as "true" in a programming language, 
but where the shell will only take a command to run.

/bin/false is the opposite that returns non-zero (a false value in the shell).

to run the executable, u have to provide the path to the command
