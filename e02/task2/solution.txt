CTRL + c:
    it does not stop the prozess, it does print ^C, and the handler gets SIGINT.

SIGKILL:
    The SIGKILL is used for immediate termination of a process. This signal cannot be ignored or blocked.
    The process will be terminated along with its threads (if any).

SIGTERM:
    The SIGTERM can also be referred as soft kill because the process that receives the SIGTERM signal may choose to ignore it.
